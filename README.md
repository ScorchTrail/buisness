# SRTtrail.dev | Local Business Web Discovery Tool

An interactive, client-facing web application designed to help local businesses scope out their digital needs. Built by SRTtrail.dev, this tool replaces boring, static forms with an engaging 4-step wizard that dynamically visualizes the client's project focus areas.

### 🌟 Features

- Interactive 4-Step Wizard: Guides local business owners through their contact info, business goals, feature priorities, and launch timeline without overwhelming technical jargon.

- Top 5 Priorities Logic: A custom checklist that limits users to selecting their top 5 core features, forcing them to prioritize what matters most.

- Dynamic Scope Visualization: Uses Chart.js to generate a beautiful, personalized Radar Chart based on the exact features and tiers the user selects.

- Auto-Save Progress: Utilizes browser localStorage to save user input on every keystroke. Clients can close the tab and return later without losing their progress.

- Early Lead Capture Foundation: Built-in logic to fire a backend webhook the moment a user completes Step 1 (Contact Info), ensuring you capture the lead even if they abandon the rest of the form.

- Instant Export & Submission: Users can instantly download their finalized answers as a cleanly formatted .txt file or forward them directly to your email using native mailto: integration.

- Celebration UI: Confetti burst animation upon successful completion!
